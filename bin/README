Pre-compiled binaries.
Slr_osx			For Mac OS X (to be dynamically linked against vecLib).
Slr_windows		For Microsoft Windows
Slr_Linux_static	For Linux. Compiled as a stand-alone version using the
			reference BLAS/LAPACK libraries. If optimised, machine
			-specific, versions of these libraries are available
			then Slr_Linux_shared will be faster.
Slr_Linux_shared	For Linux. Shared (dynamic) library version for linking
			against machine specific BLAS and LAPACK libraries.
