. Remove use of fixed length strings for options
. Check whether PAML compatible frequencies really are
  - removed option
. Seperate reoptimize function
O Use branch length estimate for reoptimization
O What happens if some branch lengths are not given
O Use OOM more
  Done for:	CodonModel.c
. Make genetic code a commandline option
. Remove global GenCode variable
O Fix MLdist
O Convert likelihood calc to use new tree iterations
. Sort out add_data_to_tree
O Multiple comparison adjustments to p-values
  O Routines for linear regression
  O chisq (p-value calculations)
  O t distribution (robust line fitting, student-t ~ N / sqrt(chisq_n/n) )
  O Minimally implement Hochberg step-up method. Nice to implement sharpened version
  and FDR techniques.
  - done FWER adjustments. Started to code gamma cumulatives for chisq
  - need to be tested.
O Separate output from optimisation of values
. Frequencies should be in terms of NumberPossibleBases
