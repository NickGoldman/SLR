In short, it's probably best not to try. The makefile may work on Unix
platforms and the batch file make.bat compiles the code on at least on
Windows machine.

  Two options can be set at compile time (as defines)
USE_BLAS	Use the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)
		library to accelerate matrix calculations.
USE_LAPACK	Use the LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACK) for matrix
		routines.

SLR does not depend on either of these libraries being available, but 
can be configured to use them for extra speed and accuracy. If BLAS is
not available, C routines are used. If LAPACK is not available, the
matrix routines from the Meshach library.

  The binary Slr_P4optimised was compiled using both the BLAS and
LAPACK libraries.
