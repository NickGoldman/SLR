This distribution of the Slr software would have been significantly
delayed without the use of code from two other authors, to replace
some FORTRAN code which would otherwise increased the effort required
for a third party to compile a working version of Slr.

Meschach library (David Stewart, des@thrain.anu.edu.au)
  A linear algebra library written in C.

Brent minimizer (Oleg Keselyov, oleg@ponder.csci.unt.edu)
  Brent's method of minimization in one dimension.

I have made minor alternations to the code for inclusion with Slr, which
are marked with comments. The original code for both these libraries 
can be obtained from http://www.netlib.org/c/


Hash table functions (Farooq Mela fmela@uci.edu)
   Dictionary library (hash tables and tree-based structures).
